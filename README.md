# Malware classification based on PE Header

A machine-learning project done for **SIT ICT3204** module. The objective of the project is to learn:
1. Understanding the data
2. Deciding on the model to use
3. Visualising result

To visualise the result, Streamlit is used. 

## Files involved

Back-end of the machine learning - assignment2.py <br/>
Front-end (Streamlit) - Team27_Streamlit.ipynb 

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JerTeo/ICT3204_Assignment_2.git
```

## Requirement
1. Google Colab 

## Usage:
1. Import Team27_Streamlit.ipynb into your Google colab. 
2. Run the notebook! 

## Output:
An URL will be generated (ending with **loca.lt**). Click on it and it will bring you to a tunnel which requires you to proceed before accessing the main Streamlit Dashboard.
